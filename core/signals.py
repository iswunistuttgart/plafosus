    1.  We search for the resources with skills,
        which match the required process step of a part manufacturing process step
        (resource_skill.skill.process_step == part_manufacturing_process_step.process_step).

    2.  If constraints are defined, we check if the ability of the skill matches the constraint

        (manufacturing_possibilities).

    4.  Using this information, we create all possible permutations. This means unique combinations of resource_skills.

    5.  Then we calculate the meta data (price, time, co2 etc) for each permutation.

    6.  Subsequently, we evaluate the single permutations.
